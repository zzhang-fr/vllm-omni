# Community Recipes

This directory contains community-maintained recipes for answering a
practical user question:

> How do I run model X on hardware Y for task Z?

Add recipes for this repository under this in-repo `recipes/` directory. To
keep naming and layout consistent, organize recipes by model vendor in a way
that is aligned with
[`vllm-project/recipes`](https://github.com/vllm-project/recipes), but treat
that external repository as a reference for structure rather than the place to
add files for this repo. Use one Markdown file per model family by default.

Example layout:

```text
recipes/
  Qwen/
    Qwen3-Omni.md
    Qwen3-TTS.md
  Tencent-Hunyuan/
    HunyuanVideo.md
```

## Available Recipes

- [`Qwen/Qwen3-Omni.md`](./Qwen/Qwen3-Omni.md): online serving recipe for
  multimodal chat on `1x A100 80GB`
- [`Wan-AI/Wan2.2-I2V.md`](./Wan-AI/Wan2.2-I2V.md): image-to-video serving
  recipe for Wan2.2 14B on `8x Ascend NPU (A2/A3)`

Within a single recipe file, include different hardware support sections such
as `GPU`, `ROCm`, and `NPU`, and add concrete tested configurations like
`1x A100 80GB` or `2x L40S` inside those sections when applicable.

See [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) for the recommended format.
