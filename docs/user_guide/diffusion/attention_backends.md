# Diffusion Attention Backends

This document describes the diffusion attention backends available in vLLM-Omni, how to select them globally and per-role, the per-platform defaults, and how to use SageAttention.

## Overview

Diffusion attention backend selection is resolved in `vllm_omni.diffusion.attention.selector`. It looks up the backend from a structured `AttentionConfig` carried on `OmniDiffusionConfig` and falls back to the platform default when nothing is configured.

This backend is used by diffusion attention layers such as the DiT attention in video and image generation models. It does **not** affect autoregressive (LLM) attention paths — those go through vLLM's own attention backend selector.

The full set of backends and their platform defaults is in the **Backend Options** and **Platform Defaults** sections below. If no attention backend is configured, vLLM-Omni asks the current platform to choose the default.

## Backend Options

| Value | Notes |
|---|---|
| `TRTLLM_ATTN` | FlashInfer's trtllm-gen FMHA (TensorRT-LLM's generated kernels, vendored by FlashInfer). BF16, GQA native, `head_dim=128`. Datacenter Blackwell only (sm_100 / sm_103). Supports **Skip-Softmax** sparse attention — see below. Requires `flashinfer`. |
| `FLASH_ATTN` | Wraps FlashAttention 2. Default on Hopper / Ada / Ampere when `flash-attn` is installed. |
| `CUDNN_ATTN` | Pins `sdpa_kernel([CUDNN_ATTENTION])`. Default on Blackwell (sm_10x / sm_12x) with cuDNN ≥ 9.5. Wins on mask-heavy DiTs (HunyuanVideo-1.5: 2× e2e vs SDPA). |
| `FLASHINFER_ATTN` | Calls FlashInfer's dense `single_prefill_with_kv_cache` directly with `custom_mask` for non-causal masked attention. Used as Blackwell fallback when cuDNN is unavailable. Requires `flashinfer`. |
| `TORCH_SDPA` | PyTorch `scaled_dot_product_attention` with the default backend dispatcher. Most conservative; always available. |
| `SAGE_ATTN` | SageAttention 2.2 — INT8-quantized attention with FP16 accumulation. Lossy but typically visually indistinguishable on diffusion outputs. Requires `sageattention`. |
| `SAGE_ATTN_3` | Requires `sageattn3` from `SageAttention/sageattention3_blackwell`. CUDA only, intended for Blackwell GPUs, with GQA/MQA requests falling back to PyTorch SDPA. |
| `FLASH_ATTN_HUB` | FlashAttention 2 from HuggingFace `kernels` library. Useful for train/rollout alignment. |
| `FLASH_ATTN_3_HUB` | FlashAttention 3 from HuggingFace `kernels` library. CUDA Hopper (sm_90+) only; falls back to `FLASH_ATTN_HUB` on older GPUs. |
| `SPARSE_ATTN` | In-tree dispatcher to **external** sparse-attention kernels registered via the `vllm_omni.sparse_attn` entry-point group (no kernels are vendored). Opt-in per role; self-attention, maskless unless the plugin advertises `supports_attention_mask`. See [Sparse attention (plugin)](#sparse-attention-plugin). |

## Configuration

Diffusion attention backends can be configured three ways, in priority order:

1. **`--diffusion-attention-config`** — structured per-role config (highest priority).
2. **`--diffusion-attention-backend` / `DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND` env var** — global shorthand that sets the default backend.
3. **Platform default** — used when nothing is configured.

`--diffusion-attention-backend` is shorthand for `--diffusion-attention-config.default.backend`. It may be combined with `--diffusion-attention-config.per_role.*` overrides, but is mutually exclusive with `--diffusion-attention-config.default.backend`.

### Global default

Set the default backend for every diffusion attention layer:

```bash
# CLI flag
vllm-omni serve <model> --diffusion-attention-backend SAGE_ATTN

# Environment variable (also recognized for backwards compatibility)
export DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=SAGE_ATTN
```

### Per-role configuration

Roles are free-form strings declared by each diffusion model. The two common categories are `"self"` and `"cross"`; model-specific roles (e.g. `"ltx2.audio_to_video"`) may also be declared. A role string is matched in this order:

1. Exact `per_role[role]` match
2. `per_role[role_category]` fallback (e.g. `"ltx2.audio_to_video"` → `"cross"`)
3. `default`
4. Platform default

Use vLLM-style dotted flags or one JSON blob:

```bash
# Dotted flags
vllm-omni serve <model> \
    --diffusion-attention-config.default.backend FLASH_ATTN \
    --diffusion-attention-config.per_role.cross.backend TORCH_SDPA

# JSON
vllm-omni serve <model> \
    --diffusion-attention-config '{"default":{"backend":"FLASH_ATTN"},"per_role":{"cross":{"backend":"TORCH_SDPA"}}}'
```

A backend that needs configuration exposes it as a typed field on the spec. Today the only
one is `TRTLLM_ATTN`'s Skip-Softmax (see [below](#trtllm_attn-backend-and-skip-softmax)):

```bash
--diffusion-attention-config.default.backend TRTLLM_ATTN \
--diffusion-attention-config.default.skip_softmax.target_sparsity 0.5
```

### Programmatic API

When constructing `OmniDiffusionConfig` directly:

```python
from vllm_omni.diffusion.data import AttentionConfig, AttentionSpec, OmniDiffusionConfig

config = OmniDiffusionConfig(
    diffusion_attention_config=AttentionConfig(
        default=AttentionSpec(backend="FLASH_ATTN"),
        per_role={
            "cross": AttentionSpec(backend="TORCH_SDPA"),
        },
    ),
    ...,
)
```

A plain dict is also accepted and normalized to `AttentionConfig`.

## Sparse attention (plugin)

`SPARSE_ATTN` is an in-tree *dispatcher*: vLLM-Omni owns only the slot, while
the actual sparse kernels ship as **external, pip-installable packages**. A kernel
package registers a callable via the `vllm_omni.sparse_attn` entry-point group
(`dummy_sparse` below is a placeholder name — use your kernel's):

```toml
# pyproject.toml of the external kernel package
[project.entry-points."vllm_omni.sparse_attn"]
dummy_sparse = "dummy_sparse_attn:attn_fn"
```

Plugin contract (a callable; device-agnostic self-attention):

```python
def attn_fn(query, key, value, params: dict, is_causal: bool, softmax_scale: float) -> torch.Tensor: ...
```

`query`/`key`/`value` use the **BSND** layout `[batch, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]`,
and the callable returns the same layout. `is_causal` and `softmax_scale` are the
standard attention scalars set by the framework (`softmax_scale` defaults to
`head_dim ** -0.5`); kernel-specific knobs and per-forward state arrive in `params`.

### Selecting a sparse kernel

Opt-in per role. The shorthand routes the plugin name through the dispatcher:

```bash
# Shorthand: backend = <plugin name>
vllm-omni serve Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-Diffusers \
    --diffusion-attention-config.per_role.self.backend dummy_sparse \
    --diffusion-attention-config.per_role.self.extra.topk 0.3

# Explicit dispatcher form (equivalent)
vllm-omni serve Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-Diffusers \
    --diffusion-attention-config '{"per_role":{"self":{"backend":"SPARSE_ATTN","extra":{"backend":"dummy_sparse","params":{"topk":0.3}}}}}'
```

Target `self` only — cross-attention keeps its dense default (sparsifying text
cross-attention degrades quality).

Shorthand `extra.*` keys are **flat kernel params** (a lone nested
`extra.params` is also accepted and hoisted); use the explicit dispatcher form
for anything more structured.

Two runtime constraints:

- **Run with `--enforce-eager` for now.** The dispatcher reads the per-step
  state (a Python int that changes every denoise step) inside the
  `torch.compile`'d transformer blocks, so each step triggers a Dynamo guard
  miss and a recompile until the compile cache demotes those blocks to eager.
  Correctness is unaffected, but compiled runs pay heavy recompile churn; a
  startup warning is emitted. This will be lifted once step state is published
  as tensors. Plugin authors: a kernel with data-dependent Python control flow
  (per-frame loops, metadata caches, JIT'd sub-kernels) should decorate its
  callable with `@torch.compiler.disable(recursive=True)` so compiled
  transformers graph-break cleanly around it instead of Dynamo tracing into it.
- **bf16/fp16 only.** For dense backends, float32 inputs silently reroute to
  SDPA; for `SPARSE_ATTN` that would silently bypass the plugin, so fp32 raises
  at the first forward instead (same fail-loud rationale as the ring-SP guard).

### The `params` dict

The dispatcher hands the kernel one flat `params` dict, merged from three tiers
(later wins, `None` dropped, so use `params.get(key, default)`):

1. **static** — the kernel's configured params (`extra.params`, or flat `extra` keys).
2. **per-forward** — canonical framework fields (`PerForwardState`): `denoise_step_idx`
   / `total_denoise_steps` as per-sample `[num_samples]` tensors (e.g.
   `progress = denoise_step_idx / total_denoise_steps`), plus **raw video-geometry
   primitives** `latent_shape` `(T, H, W)` and `patch_size` `(p_t, p_h, p_w)` as
   per-sample `[num_samples, 3]` tensors. Both the step state and the geometry
   primitives are published **generically by the framework** (a forward pre-hook on
   the transformer, reading the `(B, C, T, H, W)` latent, the model's patch config
   and the pipeline's diffusers-convention `num_timesteps`) — **no per-model code**.
   All `PerForwardState` fields are **optional by contract**: a model with no patch
   size or a non-5D latent publishes no geometry, and a pipeline that does not
   follow the `num_timesteps` convention publishes no step total, so plugins must
   handle their absence.
3. **dynamic** — the opaque `AttentionMetadata.extra`.

vLLM-Omni interprets no kernel-level parameter; the plugin reads what it needs.

#### Video geometry: default resolver and `geometry_fn`

For structure-aware kernels that map the flat sequence to (frame, patch)
coordinates, the dispatcher derives the post-patch grid from the raw primitives
and injects it into `params`:

- **default resolver** — fills `total_latent_frames = T // p_t` and
  `patches_per_frame = (H // p_h) * (W // p_w)` (as Python ints; the same fields
  arriving via `PerForwardState`/`extra` may be per-sample tensors, so read them
  type-tolerantly) whenever `latent_shape` and `patch_size` are present and the
  value isn't already set. So a kernel that just wants frame / patch counts gets
  them for free, on any video model, with no edits. The derived fields are only
  injected when `total_latent_frames * patches_per_frame == seq_len` actually
  holds for the sequence the kernel sees; when it doesn't — e.g. Ulysses SP
  auto-padding appended pad tokens, or the model mixes non-video tokens into its
  self-attention sequence — they are dropped with a one-time warning and only
  the raw primitives are passed.
- **plugin `geometry_fn`** (optional) — a callable advertised on the kernel
  (`attn_fn.geometry_fn = fn`) that runs *after* the default resolver and whose
  non-`None` returns are merged into `params`. Use it for a bespoke layout
  (block masks, CSR, ring decomposition) computed straight from the raw primitives:

```python
def geometry_fn(query_shape, params):
    ls, ps = params.get("latent_shape"), params.get("patch_size")
    if ls is None or ps is None:
        return {}                         # no geometry -> let the kernel fall back
    ...                                   # compute a bespoke representation
    return {"block_layout": ...}

attn_fn.geometry_fn = geometry_fn
```

Models that aren't `(B, C, T, H, W)` videos (image / audio, or no `patch_size`)
simply leave geometry unset; a kernel falls back to its own path — it never breaks.

### Well-known keys and capabilities

Some `params` keys carry attention inputs that change the result and are forwarded
only when the model sets them:

- `attn_mask` — validity / padding mask.
- `full_attn_spans` — per-sample `[start, end)` spans using full (bidirectional)
  attention within an otherwise causal sequence.

A plugin that consumes one of these must advertise it through an optional
`capabilities` dict on the callable. If a model provides such an input and the
plugin has not advertised support, the dispatcher raises rather than letting the
kernel ignore it:

```python
def attn_fn(query, key, value, params, is_causal, softmax_scale):
    mask = params.get("attn_mask")   # present only when advertised below
    ...

attn_fn.capabilities = {"supports_attention_mask": True}
```

### Writing a plugin

```python
# dummy_sparse_attn/__init__.py  (external package)
def attn_fn(query, key, value, params, is_causal, softmax_scale):
    # query/key/value are BSND: [batch, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]
    topk = params.get("topk", 1.0)
    step = params.get("denoise_step_idx")        # per-sample tensor, or None
    total = params.get("total_denoise_steps")    # per-sample tensor, or None
    ...                                          # call the sparse kernel (returns BSND)
    return out
```

Install it into the same environment (`pip install dummy-sparse-attn`); the
dispatcher resolves it eagerly at model init, so a missing or broken plugin fails
loudly there rather than silently falling back to dense.

## Platform Defaults

### Blackwell (sm_100 / sm_103 / sm_120 / sm_121)

Auto-route preference, in order:

1. `TRTLLM_ATTN` — on **datacenter** Blackwell (sm_100 / sm_103) when `flashinfer` is installed, the model's `head_dim` is 128, **and the model is mask-free** (see below)
2. `CUDNN_ATTN` — when cuDNN ≥ 9.5 is available (ships in PyTorch 2.5+ wheels)
3. `FLASHINFER_ATTN` — when `flashinfer` is installed but cuDNN < 9.5
4. `FLASH_ATTN` — when `flash-attn` is installed with the Blackwell CUTE kernel
5. `TORCH_SDPA` — last resort

`TRTLLM_ATTN` is skipped on workstation Blackwell (sm_120 / sm_121) and for any `head_dim != 128`, so those GPUs keep the `CUDNN_ATTN` route described below.

`TRTLLM_ATTN` outranks `CUDNN_ATTN` on datacenter Blackwell because it is the only backend that can enable Skip-Softmax, not because its dense kernel is faster — dense, the two are comparable. It cannot honor an attention mask, so the auto-default only applies to pipelines verified mask-free (the Wan family); mask-using pipelines keep `CUDNN_ATTN`. `TRTLLM_ATTN` stays available everywhere via explicit `--diffusion-attention-backend TRTLLM_ATTN` (which raises clearly if a mask is received).

The startup log line `Defaulting to diffusion attention backend CUDNN_ATTN (Blackwell sm_120, cuDNN 91002)` confirms the route.

**Why CUDNN_ATTN by default**: on mask-heavy diffusion models (HunyuanVideo-1.5, Qwen-Image), cuDNN's pinned FMHA kernel sidesteps a PyTorch SDPA dispatch quirk where the unpinned dispatcher picks `EFFICIENT_ATTENTION` (~25 ms) for masked calls instead of cuDNN (~11 ms). The pin gives 2× e2e on HV-1.5 with no regression on lighter models.

### Hopper (sm_90) / Ada (sm_89) / Ampere (sm_80–sm_86)

Auto-route preference:

1. `FLASH_ATTN` — when `flash-attn` is installed
2. `TORCH_SDPA` — fallback

`CUDNN_ATTN` and `FLASHINFER_ATTN` are still selectable via env var on these GPUs but are not in the auto-route — FlashAttention 2 is the well-tuned path on pre-Blackwell hardware.

## TRTLLM_ATTN Backend and Skip-Softmax

`TRTLLM_ATTN` runs FlashInfer's trtllm-gen FMHA. Dense it is a BF16 backend like the others; on top of
that it can enable **Skip-Softmax**, a sparse-attention mode that trades a little fidelity for speed
(algorithm: [design doc](../../design/feature/skip_softmax.md)).

Enable it through the typed `skip_softmax` block on the attention spec:

| Key | Valid values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `target_sparsity` | finite, `[0, 1]` | Operating point on a calibrated curve. Needs a calibration for the model. |
| `threshold` | finite, `≥ 0` | Direct threshold, no calibration needed. Mutually exclusive with `target_sparsity`. |
| `disabled_until_timestep` | finite, `[0, 1]` | Holds early, high-noise steps dense; skip turns on once the normalized timestep `t ≤ D`. |

```bash
vllm-omni serve Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-Diffusers \
  --diffusion-attention-config '{"default": {"backend": "TRTLLM_ATTN",
      "skip_softmax": {"target_sparsity": 0.65, "disabled_until_timestep": 0.86}}}'
```

Programmatically the same block is a typed `SkipSoftmaxSpec` (values validated at construction):

```python
from vllm_omni.diffusion.data import AttentionConfig, AttentionSpec, SkipSoftmaxSpec

AttentionConfig(
    default=AttentionSpec(
        backend="TRTLLM_ATTN",
        skip_softmax=SkipSoftmaxSpec(target_sparsity=0.65, disabled_until_timestep=0.86),
    ),
)
```

**Start at `target_sparsity=0.65, disabled_until_timestep=0.86`** and raise `target_sparsity` only
as far as your quality bar allows — the output diverges from dense as it climbs. The gain grows with
sequence length, since Skip-Softmax only accelerates attention. Dense BF16 is `TRTLLM_ATTN` with no
`skip_softmax` block.

Requires datacenter Blackwell with `head_dim == 128`; elsewhere, or without FlashInfer, selecting
`TRTLLM_ATTN` raises rather than silently degrading.

## End-to-End Benchmark (BF16, sm_120 RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell)

Same prompt and seed across runs. `Total generation time` from `text_to_video.py` / `text_to_image.py`.

| Model | Shape | TORCH_SDPA | CUDNN_ATTN | FLASHINFER_ATTN |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HunyuanVideo-1.5 (T2V) | 480p / 33f / 50 steps | 147.05 s | **73.02 s** | 127.84 s |
| Wan 2.2 14B (T2V) | 480p / 33f / 40 steps | 117.75 s | 117.17 s | **115.07 s** |
| Qwen-Image (T2I) | 1024² / 50 steps | 17.41 s | **15.14 s** | 16.02 s |
| FLUX.2-dev (T2I) | 1024² / 50 steps, TP=2 | 53.62 s | **53.30 s** | 54.94 s |

Pattern: mask-heavy DiTs (HV-1.5, Qwen-Image) favor `CUDNN_ATTN`; lighter-mask DiTs and TP-saturated configs (Wan 2.2, FLUX.2 TP=2) tie within noise.

## Known Limitations

### LTX-2.0: `CUDNN_ATTN` crashes under torch.compile

LTX-2's audio attention has a symbolic head_dim under torch.compile tracing. cuDNN's SDPA backend selector rejects symbolic dims and Dynamo aborts compilation. Tracked in [#3121](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/3121).

**Workaround**: explicitly select `FLASHINFER_ATTN` or `TORCH_SDPA` for LTX-2.0:

```bash
DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=FLASHINFER_ATTN python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model Lightricks/LTX-2 ...
```

### FA4 not yet integrated

FlashAttention-4 (released March 2026) targets Blackwell natively and reportedly beats cuDNN by ~20% on B200. As of this writing the `flash-attn-4 4.0.0b10` wheel crashes with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_trait'` during JIT on sm_120. Not yet wired into vLLM-Omni; revisit when stable lands.

## Choosing a Backend Manually

### When to override the default

- **Quality validation**: compare a new backend against `TORCH_SDPA` as the reference, since SDPA's default dispatcher is the most extensively tested.
- **Lossy speedup hunting**: try `SAGE_ATTN` (INT8 quantized) on diffusion outputs — typically indistinguishable visually but always validate.
- **Workaround for known issues**: see Known Limitations above.

### Verifying which backend is in use

The startup log prints one of:

```
Using diffusion attention backend 'CUDNN_ATTN'           # explicit override
Defaulting to diffusion attention backend CUDNN_ATTN ... # auto-route
Defaulting to diffusion attention backend SDPA           # nothing else available
```

If you don't see one of these, the model didn't reach diffusion stage init — check earlier logs for failures.

## SageAttention Installation

vLLM-Omni expects SageAttention to be installed into the same Python environment as vLLM-Omni.

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git
cd SageAttention

export EXT_PARALLEL=4 NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS="--threads 8" MAX_JOBS=32
pip install . --no-build-isolation
```

Quick check:

```bash
python -c "import sageattention; print(sageattention.__file__)"
```

## SageAttention3 Installation

vLLM-Omni expects SageAttention3 to be installed into the same Python environment as vLLM-Omni.

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git
cd SageAttention/sageattention3_blackwell
python setup.py install
```

Quick check:

```bash
python -c "import sageattn3; print(sageattn3.__file__)"
```

Notes:

- `SAGE_ATTN_3` is only selected on CUDA when `sageattn3` is importable and the GPU is Blackwell-class.
- SageAttention3's Blackwell kernel assumes `Hq == Hkv`. In vLLM-Omni, GQA/MQA diffusion requests fall back to PyTorch SDPA for correctness.

## HuggingFace Kernels Hub Backends

To achieve perfect numerical consistency between **training** (typically using HuggingFace Diffusers with Hub kernels) and **serving/rollout** (using vLLM-Omni), you can use the Hub-based attention backends. This eliminates numerical drift / sampling divergence caused by executing different local kernel versions during rollout.

The following backend options are supported:
- `FLASH_ATTN_HUB` (HuggingFace `kernels-community/flash-attn2`)
- `FLASH_ATTN_3_HUB` (HuggingFace `kernels-community/flash-attn3`, Hopper sm_90+ only)

### Installation

To use these backends, you must install the `kernels` library:

```bash
pip install kernels==0.14.1
```

If the `kernels` library is not available in the environment, vLLM-Omni will log a warning and fall back gracefully to the corresponding local backend implementations (`FLASH_ATTN`). On CUDA GPUs below Hopper (compute capability < 9.0), `FLASH_ATTN_3_HUB` falls back to `FLASH_ATTN_HUB`.

### Usage

Select a Hub backend using the global CLI flag or environment variables:

```bash
# Environment variable
export DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=FLASH_ATTN_HUB

# CLI flag
vllm-omni serve <model> --diffusion-attention-backend FLASH_ATTN_HUB
```

## Usage Examples

### Default (auto-route)

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model hunyuanvideo-community/HunyuanVideo-1.5-Diffusers-480p_t2v \
    --prompt "A dog running across a field of golden wheat." \
    --height 480 --width 832 --num-frames 33 \
    --num-inference-steps 50 --seed 42 --guidance-scale 6.0 \
    --output hv15.mp4
```

On Blackwell this picks `CUDNN_ATTN` automatically. Check the log for the `Defaulting to ...` line.

### Explicit backend selection

```bash
DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=FLASHINFER_ATTN python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model Lightricks/LTX-2 \
    --prompt "A dog running across a field of golden wheat." \
    --height 480 --width 832 --num-frames 33 \
    --num-inference-steps 40 --seed 42 --guidance-scale 4.0 \
    --output ltx2.mp4
```

### SageAttention (lossy)

```bash
DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=SAGE_ATTN python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model hunyuanvideo-community/HunyuanVideo-1.5-Diffusers-480p_t2v \
    --prompt "A dog running across a field of golden wheat." \
    --height 480 --width 832 --num-frames 33 \
    --num-inference-steps 30 --seed 42 --guidance-scale 6.0 \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --output hv15_sage.mp4
```

Example: Wan2.2 TI2V 5B

```bash
DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=SAGE_ATTN python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers \
    --prompt "A dog running across a field of golden wheat." \
    --height 704 --width 1280 --num-frames 49 \
    --num-inference-steps 30 --seed 42 --guidance-scale 5.0 \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --output outputs/wan22_sage.mp4
```

### Enable SageAttention3

Example:

```bash
DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=SAGE_ATTN_3 python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model hunyuanvideo-community/HunyuanVideo-1.5-Diffusers-480p_t2v \
    --prompt "A dog running across a field of golden wheat." \
    --height 480 --width 832 --num-frames 33 \
    --num-inference-steps 30 --seed 42 --guidance-scale 6.0 \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --output outputs/hv15_sage3.mp4
```

### Mixed backends across roles

Use `FLASH_ATTN` for self-attention and `TORCH_SDPA` for cross-attention:

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers \
    --prompt "A dog running across a field of golden wheat." \
    --diffusion-attention-config.per_role.self.backend FLASH_ATTN \
    --diffusion-attention-config.per_role.cross.backend TORCH_SDPA \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --output outputs/wan22_mixed.mp4
```

### Compare against FlashAttention

Unset the backend override, or explicitly use `FLASH_ATTN`:

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/text_to_video/text_to_video.py \
    --model Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers \
    --prompt "A dog running across a field of golden wheat." \
    --height 704 --width 1280 --num-frames 49 \
    --num-inference-steps 30 --seed 42 --guidance-scale 5.0 \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
    --output outputs/wan22_fa3.mp4
```

## Validation Guidance

Don't assume a faster attention backend is numerically interchangeable with `TORCH_SDPA`.

Always compare:

- End-to-end runtime
- Diffusion-stage runtime (`add_req_and_wait` line in DiffusionEngine.step breakdown)
- Output quality against a known-good baseline (CLIP similarity, frame-level diff, or visual review)

At minimum, keep the same:

- model
- prompt

## Reproducing the Benchmark Table

The end-to-end numbers above were collected by running `text_to_video.py` /
`text_to_image.py` with the same prompt and seed while varying
`DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND`. For a quick kernel-level comparison of the
backends without loading a model:

```bash
python benchmarks/diffusion/bench_attention_backends.py --preset hv15
```

It runs all three BF16 backends on representative DiT attention shapes and
prints a ranking table at the end.
